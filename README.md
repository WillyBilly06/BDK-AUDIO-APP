# BDK Audio App

A professional Android companion application for controlling ESP32-based Bluetooth speakers with DSP (Digital Signal Processing) capabilities and audio-reactive LED matrix effects.

## Overview

BDK Audio App provides a comprehensive control interface for managing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connected ESP32 audio devices. The application enables users to adjust DSP parameters, monitor real-time audio levels, select LED visualization effects, rename the device, and perform firmware updates over-the-air.

| Connection | DSP Controls | LED Effects |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| Scan and connect to your ESP32 speaker | Adjust EQ, bass boost, and channel settings | Choose from 21 audio-reactive LED effects |

## Features

### 🔗 Bluetooth Connectivity
- BLE device scanning with service UUID filtering
- Automatic MTU negotiation (up to 517 bytes for fast OTA)
- Real-time connection status monitoring
- Switch between multiple devices
- Reads current device settings on connect (EQ, DSP toggles, LED effect)

### 🎛️ DSP Control
- **Bass Boost**: Toggle hardware bass enhancement
- **Channel Flip**: Swap left/right audio channels
- **EQ Bypass**: Bypass all DSP processing
- **3-Band Equalizer**: Adjustable Bass, Mid, and Treble (-12 to +12 dB)
- Real-time audio level meters (30 Hz, 60 Hz, 100 Hz bands)

### 💡 LED Effects (21 Modes)
Choose from 21 audio-reactive visualization effects for the 16x16 WS2812B LED matrix:

| ID | Effect | ID | Effect | ID | Effect |
|----|--------|----|---------|----|--------|
| 0 | Spectrum Bars | 7 | Starfield | 14 | Bass Reactor |
| 1 | Beat Pulse | 8 | Wave | 15 | Meteor Shower |
| 2 | Ripple | 9 | Fireworks | 16 | Breathing |
| 3 | Fire | 10 | Rainbow Wave | 17 | DNA Helix |
| 4 | Plasma | 11 | Particle Burst | 18 | Audio Scope |
| 5 | Matrix Rain | 12 | Kaleidoscope | 19 | Bouncing Balls |
| 6 | VU Meter | 13 | Frequency Spiral | 20 | Lava Lamp |

### 📝 Device Management
- Rename your ESP32 speaker (persisted in NVS)
- View current firmware version
- Device info screen with connection details

### 📲 Over-the-Air Firmware Updates
- Select firmware binary (.bin) from device storage
- High-speed BLE transfer using Write-No-Response
- Real-time progress bar with KB transferred
- Progress-based throttling for reliable transfers
- Automatic ESP32 reboot on completion

### 🎨 User Interface
- Modern dark theme with Material Design 3 components
- Card-based responsive layout
- Edge-to-edge display with proper inset handling
- MaterialSwitch toggles and styled spinners
- Gradient progress bars for audio meters
